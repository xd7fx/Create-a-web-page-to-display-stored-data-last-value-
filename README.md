# Create-a-web-page-to-display-stored-data-last-value-
This is a web page that displays the last stored command value from a phpMyAdmin database. The data is fetched from the database and displayed in a clean, simple interface. The design allows users to easily see the most recent command sent to the robot. The project runs locally using a server like XAMPP or MAMP.
